            <p>MBA Candidate in Software Engineering @FIAP (in progress | São Paulo, Brazil)

                Can you imagine working with a Junior with more than 15 years of professional experience?
                
                I am a graduate student in Software Engineering at FIAP and I am excited to transition into the field of Software Engineering and bring my skills and perspectives to solve technological problems.
                
                I've been honing my skills in Github, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML5 and CSS3 and I'm looking forward to putting my knowledge to use in a professional environment. A fast learner and problem solver at heart, I can't wait to take on new challenges and grow as a software developer.</p>
