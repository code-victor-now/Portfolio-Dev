            <p>MBA Candidate in Software Engineering @FIAP (in progress | São Paulo, Brazil)
                Interactive Media Designer - College Diploma | @Seneca College (2017-19 | Toronto, Canada)
                
                Can you imagine working with a Junior with more than 15 years of professional experience?
                
                I am a graduate student in Software Engineering at FIAP and I am excited to transition into the field of Software Engineering and bring my skills and perspectives to solve technological problems.
                
                I've been honing my skills in Github, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML5 and CSS3 and I'm looking forward to putting my knowledge to use in a professional environment. A fast learner and problem solver at heart, I can't wait to take on new challenges and grow as a software developer.</p>
            <p>In the past years I have worked with multicultural teams optimising work processes in the national and international market, creating compelling experiences that solve complex problems. I have the ability to play well with teams from different backgrounds and I enjoy the workplace collaboration. 

                I have experience working across the entire design thinking process—from deep customer understanding to conceptualizing, prototyping, and testing— as a designer, I apply a human-centered approach to help you create the products, services, and experiences that will power your strategy and ensure you realize your vision.
                
                The space between technology and art is where I thrive.
